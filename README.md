### Objective
Get hands-on practice defining and calling your own custom Python functions with parameters and return values.

---

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Basic Greeter Function
- Define a function named `greet(name)`.
- Inside the function, print `"Hello, [name]!"`.
- Call your function three times with different names.

#### Task 2: Return a Value
- Define a function named `square(number)` that returns `number * number`.
- Call it with a number (like `5`), store the result in a variable named `result`, and print it.

#### Task 3: The Full Calculator
- Define four functions:
  - `add(num1, num2)`
  - `subtract(num1, num2)`
  - `multiply(num1, num2)`
  - `divide(num1, num2)`
- Each function should return the result of its operation.
- Call and print each one with sample numbers.
